# Cleanup Note

The `Board.tsx` component has been replaced by `EnhancedBoard.tsx` and is no longer used in the application.

Once you've confirmed that the `EnhancedBoard.tsx` component is working correctly, you can safely delete the `Board.tsx` file.

You may delete this file with:

```bash
rm /Users/fredbenenson/cozen/cozen-v2/src/boardgame/components/Board.tsx
```

All references to the original `Board.tsx` component and `CozenBoard` have been removed from the application.
