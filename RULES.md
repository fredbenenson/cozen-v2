# 🎴 Cozen v0.2.2

*A card game of strategy, guts, and deception by Zach Gage*

## 🎯 Goal
Be the first player to capture 70 Victory Points worth of your opponent's cards!

## 🃏 The Deck
- Each player gets their own deck (26 cards)
- Red player gets all red cards, Black player gets all black cards
- Each deck contains 2 copies of each card (A-K)
- Special rule: The King of Hearts (Red) and King of Spades (Black) are marked with an X
- Suits don't matter beyond card color

## 💯 Victory Points
- Number cards (2-10) = Face value
- Face cards (J, Q, K) = 10 points
- Marked Kings = 70 points

## 🎮 Game Setup
1. Separate the deck into Red and Black cards
2. Players shuffle their decks
3. Each player places one card face-up in the Stakes row
4. Each player draws 5 cards
5. The player furthest from the box goes first (alternate in subsequent rounds)

## ⚔️ Player Actions
On your turn, you must choose ONE of these actions:

### 1. 📥 Stake & Draw
- Place one card face-down in the rightmost position of the Stakes row
- Draw one card from your deck

### 2. 🎲 Wager
- Place any number of cards face-down below any staked card (on your side)
- Don't draw any cards
- You can add more cards to your wagered hands later

## 🏆 Scoring Combinations

### Pairs (👥)
- Two matching cards = 3 Strength
- Example: Two 7s = 3 Strength

### Straights (📈)
- Connected sequence of cards = 1 Strength per card
- Minimum 2 cards
- Aces can be high (K,A) or low (A,2) but not both
- Example: 5,6,7 = 3 Strength

Important Rules:
- Only one straight can score per hand
- A card can only be used in one combination
- The order cards are played doesn't matter

## 🎯 Stakes Row Cards
- Usually just fought over (doesn't add strength to owner's side)
- EXCEPT: If you can include it in a combination on your side
- You can only use your own stake card (red player uses red stakes, black uses black)

## 🏁 End of Round
1. When a player plays their last card
2. Other player gets one final turn
3. Reveal all contested hands (hands with cards from both players)
4. Uncontested hands return to owners without revealing

### Breaking Ties
If both players have equal strength:
1. Highest card wins (not counting stakes unless in a combination)
2. If still tied, compare next highest cards
3. If completely tied, all cards return to owners

## 🔄 Starting New Rounds
- Return non-jailed cards to decks
- Shuffle decks
- Begin new round

Special Rule: If no cards were captured, keep the stakes and add two new ones next round (4 total)

## 👥 2v2 Mode
- Need two full decks
- Teams sit across from each other
- Each player gets half a deck in their color
- No communication between teammates
- Win at 100 Victory Points
- Only first and second players flip stakes at start
- Follow turn order shown on reference card

## 💡 Strategy Tips
- Pairs give most strength per card
- Consider your deck strength (jailed pairs weaken future hands)
- Risk cards that pair with opponent's jailed cards
- Split strong hands across multiple battles
- Every move is both strategy and wager

# 🎴 Quick Reference
- Pair = 3 Strength
- Straight = 1 Strength per card (minimum 2)
